#Homework 5

##Reflections on the Process
**Once again, I ran out of time in completing this homework. I managed to address the main challenges of this homework. I kept the solutions simple. I did not try to be ambitious with my solutions. At the very least I tried to show what I have learned. So there is a definitely a lot for me to improve. Learning R has been most challenging for me. But I have enjoyed learning it. And I need to practice some more-- which I will be able to do when I begin visualizing data for my dissertation.**

###Cleaning up your repo!

**I edited the ReadMe file for the entire repo. I want my introductions to be more professional than the earlier iteration. I have also organized the folders. But I did not have time to do the Table of Contents.**
