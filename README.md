It took me awhile to figure out how to edit this page. But writing and editing the text: easy. 
Not sure if the pulling will work. I guess we'll see.

OK. So I was able to push from my local to here. And I noted this earlier. But I did not press commit. So I have to do it again.

I have also pushed the HW01_gapminded.Rmd and companion file.
